Array VS ArrayList

Array is fixed in size , can not be resized once being created
ArrayList can grow and shrink anytime

Array can store primitives and object
ArrayList can only store Object !!!!
		-- any primitive values will be wrapped into wrapper type object
		-- AUTOBOXED

Array can not be printed directly (need to use Arrays.toStirng(arrObject))
ArrayList (along with every other collection type in java)
	  can be printed directly to see whats inside(toStirng method overriden)

ArrayList has its own class and lots of ready method we can use
to easily manipulate data
Array :  it does not have convinient methods ready like ArrayList
			we can use Arrays utility class instead

  we use length property of Array object to count the items
  we use size() method of ArrayList to count the items

---------
List is the only ordered collection in entire collection framework
with index : NON OF THE OTHER COLLECTION TYPE PROVIDE INDEXED ACCESS!!!

-- Iterator -- see it as a tool to iterate over a collection
		-- with basic functionlity

in order to get an Iterator object we can call the method

		List<Integer> lst = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(20,10,44,3,11));

		Iterator<Integer> numIter = lst.iterator();
		// 3 methods available : hasNext() , next() , remove
